# Credit Risk Prediction for the ID/X Partners Data Scientist Project Based Internship Program


This project was completed as the **final task** of the **ID-X Partners Data Scientist Project-Based Internship** in collaboration with **Rakamin Academy**. The goal was to develop a machine learning model to predict **credit risk** for a lending company. By analyzing historical loan data, the model aims to help the company make more informed lending decisions, reduce the likelihood of defaults, and ultimately minimize financial loss.

The internship program provided valuable hands-on experience, allowing the application of data science techniques, including data cleaning, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation. This project serves as a demonstration of the skills and knowledge acquired throughout the program.

## Dataset Source

The dataset is provided by **ID/X Partners** and contains historical loan data, including borrower demographics, loan details, and loan status.

## Approach

1. **Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - The dataset is cleaned by handling missing values, removing irrelevant features, and ensuring the data is in the correct format.
   - **EDA** is performed to explore the relationships between features and the target variable, identifying key trends, correlations, and potential issues with the data.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Relevant features are selected based on insights from the EDA.
   - Categorical variables are encoded, and numerical features are scaled or transformed as necessary to prepare the data for the machine learning model.

3. **Model Building**:
   - A **Random Forest classifier** is used to build the model, as it is effective in handling large datasets and identifying complex patterns in the data to predict **credit risk**.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - The modelâ€™s performance is evaluated using classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC to ensure its effectiveness in predicting credit risk.

This project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to predict **credit risk** for lending companies. By automating the credit assessment process, the model helps the company make more informed decisions and minimize the risk of loan defaults. Future improvements could include hyperparameter tuning and incorporating additional features to enhance model performance.
